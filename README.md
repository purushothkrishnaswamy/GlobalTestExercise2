## Instructions and deliverables

* Design and implement an extensible test framework to run and verify the above user journey. This should incorporate the best practices of the tooling you chose, and will be reviewed against extensibility and clean code.
* Writing the tests Use Java([Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)) or Javascript([Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/))
* We don't expect every single aspect of the journey to be thoroughly tested, but would expect to see some set of scenarios tested
* A README.md file explaining the framework briefly and how to run the tests, what you need installed
* Pushed to GitHub for review
